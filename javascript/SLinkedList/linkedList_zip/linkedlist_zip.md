# Challenge Title

**linked-list-zip**
**Description:**
Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## The Approach & Efficiency and solution:
Approach:

Create an empty linked list called zippedList to store the merged result.
Initialize two pointers, current1 and current2, to the heads of list1 and list2 respectively.
Iterate over both lists simultaneously until either list1 or list2 reaches the end.
Append the value of current1 to zippedList and move current1 to the next node (if it exists).
Append the value of current2 to zippedList and move current2 to the next node (if it exists).
If there are remaining nodes in list1, append them to zippedList.
If there are remaining nodes in list2, append them to zippedList.
Return zippedList.
Efficiency:

Time complexity: The function iterates over the nodes of both list1 and list2 once, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both lists.
Space complexity: The function creates a new linked list, zippedList, to store the merged result. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both lists since the size of the merged list can be at most n.

the code inside LinkedList.js,and Node.js files

**Testing**
**Testing for finde node at given index**


all these test cases passed successfully without failed âœ”
(you can see how I did the testing for my code inside LinkedList.test.js)
